# OSRS Trivia Game Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying the OSRS Trivia Game step-by-step, even if you have little to no experience with web development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. A GitHub account (free) - To store your code
2. A MongoDB Atlas account (free tier) - For the database
3. A Heroku account (free tier) - For hosting the application

## Step 1: Set Up GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in (or create an account)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "osrs-trivia-game")
4. Make it "Public" and click "Create repository"
5. Follow the instructions on the next page to upload the code (we'll do this later)

## Step 2: Set Up MongoDB Atlas Database

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for a free account
2. Once signed in, click "Create" to make a new project
3. Name your project (e.g., "OSRS Trivia") and click "Next"
4. You can skip adding members by clicking "Create Project"
5. Click "Build a Database" and select the "FREE" option
6. Choose your preferred provider (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) and region (pick one close to you)
7. Click "Create Cluster" (this will take a few minutes)
8. Once your cluster is ready, click "Connect"
9. Click "Add Your Current IP Address" to add your IP to the allowlist
10. Create a database user by entering a username and password - **IMPORTANT**: Remember these credentials!
11. Click "Choose a connection method"
12. Select "Connect your application"
13. Copy the connection string - You'll need to replace `<password>` with your actual password later

## Step 3: Prepare Your Code for Deployment

1. In your downloaded code, create a file named `.env` in the root directory
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_from_step_2
JWT_SECRET=a_random_string_for_security
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

3. Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string_from_step_2` with the connection string from MongoDB Atlas
4. Replace `a_random_string_for_security` with a random string (e.g., "osrs-trivia-super-secret-key-123")

## Step 4: Set Up Heroku for Deployment

1. Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign up for a free account
2. Once signed in, click the "New" button and select "Create new app"
3. Enter an app name (must be unique, e.g., "osrs-trivia-game-yourusername")
4. Choose a region close to you and click "Create app"
5. On the next page, go to the "Settings" tab
6. Scroll down to "Config Vars" and click "Reveal Config Vars"
7. Add the same environment variables from your `.env` file:
   - KEY: `MONGODB_URI`, VALUE: Your MongoDB connection string
   - KEY: `JWT_SECRET`, VALUE: Your secret key
   - KEY: `NODE_ENV`, VALUE: `production`
8. Scroll down to "Buildpacks" and click "Add buildpack"
9. Select "nodejs" and click "Save changes"

## Step 5: Deploy Your Code to Heroku

There are two ways to deploy: using Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface) or connecting to GitHub. We'll use the GitHub method as it's easier for beginners.

1. In Heroku, go to the "Deploy" tab
2. In the "Deployment method" section, click "GitHub"
3. Connect your GitHub account if prompted
4. Search for your repository name and click "Connect"
5. Scroll down to "Manual deploy" section
6. Select the "main" branch and click "Deploy Branch"
7. Wait for the deployment to complete (you'll see "Your app was successfully deployed")
8. Click "View" to see your deployed application!

## Step 6: Import Initial Questions

After deploying, you need to import the sample questions:

1. Go to your Heroku dashboard
2. Click on your app
3. Click the "More" button in the top-right corner
4. Select "Run console"
5. Enter: `node scripts/importQuestions.js`
6. Press "Run"
7. Wait for the script to complete

## Step 7: Test Your Deployed Application

1. Click the "Open app" button in Heroku to visit your deployed application
2. Test the registration and login functionality
3. Try playing a trivia game to make sure everything works
4. Check the leaderboard and profile pages

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Application crashes or shows "Application Error"

1. In Heroku, go to "More" > "View logs"
2. Look for error messages to identify the problem
3. Common issues include:
   - Incorrect MongoDB connection string
   - Missing environment variables
   - Syntax errors in the code

### Database connection issues

1. Check that your MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
2. Verify that your IP address is in the allowlist
3. Make sure your database username and password are correct in the connection string

### Questions not appearing

1. Make sure you've run the import script (Step 6)
2. Check the Heroku logs for any errors during import

## Updating Your Application

If you make changes to the code:

1. Make your changes locally
2. Commit them to GitHub
3. In Heroku, go to the "Deploy" tab
4. Scroll down to "Manual deploy" and click "Deploy Branch" again

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain instead of the default Heroku URL:

1. Purchase a domain from a registrar like Namecheap or GoDaddy
2. In Heroku, go to the "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Domains" and click "Add domain"
4. Follow the instructions to set up DNS records with your domain provider

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your OSRS Trivia Game. Your application is now live on the internet and can be accessed by anyone with the URL.

If you encounter any issues during deployment, refer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) or [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/) for more detailed help.
